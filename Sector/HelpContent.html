  <h1>Sector Help</h1>
  <p>Sector is a desktop utility for exploring and modifying classic Macintosh disk images.</p>

  <h2>Supported Disk Images</h2>
  <p><strong>Sector supports classic HFS volumes only.</strong> It does not support HFS+ or APFS.</p>
  <p>If an image contains multiple HFS partitions, Sector prompts you to choose which partition to open.</p>

  <h2>Working with Files</h2>
  <p>• Drag files or folders from Finder into Sector to copy them into the selected directory.<br>
  • Drag files or folders from Sector into Finder to export them.<br>
  • You can also use the toolbar or the <strong>Volume</strong> menu for Copy In, Copy Out, Rename, and Delete.<br>
  • Replace and delete operations require confirmation before changes are applied.</p>

  <h2>Good Practice</h2>
  <p>• Keep a backup of important disk images before editing.<br>
  • Volume statistics refresh after import, rename, and delete operations.<br>
  • If import or export fails, check Finder permissions and image write access.</p>
